# NavPy

## Introduction
A 2D navigation stack that takes in information from odometry, sensor streams, and a goal pose and outputs velocity commands that are sent to a mobile base. As a prerequisite for navigation stack use, the robot must be running ROS, have a tf transform tree in place, and publish sensor data using the correct ROS Message types. Also, the navigation stack needs to be configured for the shape and dynamics of a robot. The algorithm was tested with a [simulation of the Festo Robotino robot (RTO)](https://github.com/dietriro/rto_simulation) in a virtual world in Gazebo.

## Packages
In the following, all packages within this repository that are related to the NavPy navigation stack are briefly explained.

### rto_costmap_generator
#### Description
This package contains the 'costmap_generator_node', which is used for generating the local and the global costmap. 

In order to allow the use of a point representation of the mobile robot for path planning, the static map from the map server has to be padded by the radius of the mobile robot and by an additional, optional safety distance. This leads to an area in that the robot should under no circumstances operate in. Therefore, the system will efficiently prevent the robot from crashing into obstacles that are positioned in the global costmap. This area is called the area of 'hard padding'. To additionally assign a higher cost to grid cells that are close to obstacles, a so called 'soft padding' area gets generated by the costmap generator. The robot is allowed to operate in this area but path planning through parts of the 'soft padded area' will lead to an additional cost that is taken into account by the global planner. 

The global costmap is an occupancy grid map. Grid cells that are occupied by obstacles have the value 100, grid cells in the area of 'hard padding' the value 99 and grid cells in the area of 'soft padding' the values from 98 to 1. Free space is represented with the value 0 and unknown space with the value -1. Figures 2 - 4 will represent three costmaps with the same 'hard padding' area but different types and sizes of the 'soft padding' area.

In a real world scenario it is not enough to make decisions based on a static global costmap, since dynamic changes in the surrounding might lead to significant changes in the global costmap. If these changes are not recognized by the system, the accuracy of the localization will be drastically reduced. Therefore, obstacles that are not taken into account by the current version of the global costmap have to be recognized and added in order to allow a smooth and stable navigation of the mobile robot. The local costmap serves this purpose by considering the current laser scan range measurements. Fig.5 depicts the local costmap and an obstacle that is currently not part of the global costmap.

### rto_local_planner
#### Description
This package contains the local_planner_node, which creates a local path and allows the robot to follow the global path to reach the navigation goal.

The local planner implemented in this package is based on the dynamic window approach, which is an online collision avoidance strategy that samples trajectories from a generated, valid search space and selects the best trajectory for the current situation with the help of a cost function. The cost function consists of four different separate costs and is minimized in order to obtain the optimal control values. The four parts of the cost function are:

- cost based on linear velocity
- cost based on the angle towards the goal
- cost based on the proximity to the global path 
- cost based on the proximity to obstacles

The overall cost for a control pair is 0 if the robot travels with its maximal linear velocity, looks directly towards the goal, is exactly on the global path and the distance to the closest obstacle is as big as possible. Based on the gain factors of the different costs the local planner will exhibit a certain behaviour. If the robot, for example, should dynamically avoid obstacles that are not part of the costmap, it would make sense to reduce the gain of the cost that is based on the proximity to the global path and increase the gain of the cost that is related to the proximity to obstacles. If the robot should however follow exactly the global path, different gain values might make more sense. The following GIFs show two completely different strategies for local planning.

<table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; table-layout: fixed; width: 100%">
  <tr>
    <td style="width: 48%;"> <img src="resources/gifs/obstacle_avoidance.gif" width="350"/></td>
    <td style="width: 48%;"> <img src="resources/gifs/path_following.gif" width="350"/></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="width: 48%;" valign="top"> <b>GIF 2:</b> Local planner focuses on avoiding obstacles (gain values: 18 12 15 15).
    </td>
    <td style="width: 48%;" valign="top"> <b>GIF 3:</b> Local planner focuses on staying on the global path (gain values: 28 2 80 1).
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Of course both strategies have advantages and disadvantages and it depends on the situation which version to use.
Please be aware of the fact that the parameters are tuned for the robot to work in the Gazebo simulation environment. Applying the local planner to real world conditions might require additional parameter tuning.

The local planner node not only estimates the best control values, but also initialize a so called recovery behaviour that adds the local costmap to the global costmap via the service 'add_local_costmap' and publishes the current goal position again to initiate a re-planning of the global path. This is necessary in order to allow the system to react to changes of the world it operates in. Therefore, the local planner needs a couple of measures to decide if a recovery behaviour is necessary. The implemented measures are listed below:

- small linear velocity
- circling
- execution time of the current path

Based on the values of the related parameters a recovery behaviour will be carried out when the linear velocity is below a certain threshold for a certain amount of time. This can often be traced back to a global path blocked by an obstacle that is currently not included in the global costmap. This particular case can also lead to the robot circling in front of the obstacle. For this reason, a recovery behaviour is also initialized when the sign of the robot's angular velocity does not change for a specific time period. The last measure for initializing a recovery behaviour is the execution time of the current path. If the robot takes longer than expected to reach the goal position, this might also indicate that a recovery behaviour makes sense in this situation. The GIFs below demonstrate the typical scenarios that lead to an initialization and execution of a recovery behaviour.

### rto_localization
#### Description
This package contains the rto_localization node, which is responsible for localizing the robot in a map. When the rto_localization is launched it requests the map from the rto_map_server. For localizing the robot, a Monte Carlo localization algorithm is used. The navigation stack is able to work in a dynamic environment. Obstacles which are not included in the map will reduce the accuracy of the Monte Carlo localization drastically. Therefore, the map is updated by the rto_costmap_generator. The performance of the Monte Carlo localization is measured by the averaged error of all particles. This performance measurement is used to decide whether the pose of the robot is estimated by the Monte Carlo localization or the odometry. The Monte Carlo localization is used if the error is smaller than a given threshold. Otherwise, the estimated pose from the last iteration is updated according to the relative motion since then. The relative motion is received from the odometry. This is especially important when the robot senses a dynamic obstacle which is not yet included in the map. Such situations can be seen in the following. In GIF 7 the robot passes a dynamic obstacle solely by using the local planer. The obstacle is not included in the map. In GIF 8 the global path is recalculated by the global planer and the map is updated. In both situations the robot pose is estimated by the odometry as long as the robot senses the unknown obstacle. After updating the map or passing the obstacle the Monte Carlo localization is accurate again and can be used to estimate the robot pose.


<table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; table-layout: fixed; width: 100%">

    <td style="width: 48%;"> <img src="resources/gifs/localization_obsactle_avoidance.gif" width="350"/></td>

  </tr>
</table>

If the localization is not accurate for several iterations it might happen, that the particles drift away. By predicting the particles with a higher variance, the particles spread out. This allows the Monte Carlo localization to catch the pose of the robot again. It can be seen in GIF 9. To make sure, that the variance is not dominating the prediction of the particles, it is adapted to the angular and translational velocity of the robot.

### rto_global_planner
#### Description
This package contains the global_planner_node, which creates a global path that can be used by the local_planner to navigate the robot towards the goal.

This package contains the global_planner_node, which creates a global path that can be used by the local_planner to navigate the robot towards the goal.
The global planner is based on a bidirectional A-Star algorithm. At the beginning, we start the search from both the robot's position and the goal position. After each iteration, the global planner will check whether there is an intersection between the open list of searching from the start point and that of the end point. If there is an intersection, then the global planner connects the path from the start point to the end point. It might be the case that the path looks like in Fig.6. So the global planner will then apply path smoothing to avoid unnecessary turns (see Fig.7). At last, to make sure that the local_planner will get a dense path that is represented by nodes next to each other, path augmentation is applied (see Fig.8).

  </tr>
</table>

In some cases, the global planner might not find a path from the current position of the robot to the goal. In this situation, the global planner will make a call to the service `/clear_map` to reset the global costmap to its original state. This might delete obstacles that have been added to the global costmap at an earlier time that are not at this position anymore. Doing this might allow the global planner to find a valid path to the goal position. This procedure is also considered as recovery behaviour. A situation where this recovery behaviour helps to plan a valid path toward the goal (see GIF 10).
